			<p> JSF uses MVC model i.e., Model - View - Controller model. With the MVC Design Pattern, you take some key functionality of the application and break it up 
				into smaller components.

			<h3 style="margin:100px 0 0 0">The JavaServer Faces (JSF) Framework</h3>
			
			<p>JSF is a framework for building web applications in Java. Web apps can be built either by using servlets or jsp or even using other frameworks like Struts, 
				Spring MVC.
			</p>
			
			<p>However, JSF is the standard web application framework for the Java Enterprise Edition as published by Oracle; thus, it has all the standard 
				specifications for building Web applications using Java.
			</p>
			
			<p>Since JSF is a very popular framework, many Java development teams use it for building their web applications. </p>
			
		
			<h3>Components of a JSF Application</h3>
			
			<p>At a very high level, these are the actual components of a JSF application:</p>
			
			<p><strong>Web Page:</strong>
				 A JSF application is basically a set of web pages to lay out user interface components. We will make use of a special JSF technology called
				 <em>Facelets.</em>
			</p>
			
			<p><strong>Beans:</strong> 
				A JSF application is also composed of a set of managed beans. This is the Java code that you will have in the background for holding form data.
				It is also used to perform back-end operations like talking to a database.
			</p>
			
			<p><strong>Deployment Descriptor:</strong> 
				There is also an idea of the web deployment descriptor or a web.xml file. Basically, we put some special configurations in that file to handle JSF requests.
			</p>
			
			<p>There are also some optional configuration files, like faces-config.xml. Some custom objects, components, custom tags and validators can also be dropped in.</p>
			
			<h3>How JSF Works Behind the Scenes</h3>

			<p>A user submits a request to our application server using their web browser. It will come into our 
				<em>JSF Faces Servlet.</em> The servlet is part of the JSF library, and you don&rsquo;t have to write it. It handles the routing requests to the appropriate pages.
			</p>
			
			<p>In the background, the faces servlet can read information from the 
				<em>faces-config.xml</em> file. It can also make use of <em>Managed Beans</em>. These managed beans basically hold the form data. They also talk to 
				the back-end processes like your database.
			</p>
	
			<p>The faces servlet will determine and route to an appropriate web page – for example, something like 
				<em>hello-world.xhtml</em>. Pages like it can also use the managed bean to retrieve or display information from the back-end system.
			</p>
			
			<p>At the end, the web page is rendered and sent back to the web browser of the user. It can be simple enough to show some messages on the browser, 
				or it can display something complex like the results of a database query.
			</p>
