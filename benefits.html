			<h3 style="margin:100px 0 0 0"> Benefits of JSF</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>The greatest advantages of JavaServer Faces technology is that it offers a clean separation between behavior and presentation. 
					Web applications built using JSP technology achieve this separation in part.
				</li>
				<li>  The separation of logic from presentation also allows each member of a web application development team to focus on his or her
					piece of the development process, and it provides a simple programming model to link the pieces. 
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Facelets technology offers several advantages.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>
						<p>Code can be reused and extended for components through the templating and composite component features.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
						<p><a name="indexterm-210"></a>When you use the JavaServer Faces Annotations feature, you can automatically register the managed bean as a resource 
							available for JavaServer Faces applications. In addition, <strong>implicit navigation</strong> rules allow developers to quickly configure page navigation.
							These features reduce the manual configuration process for applications.
						</p>
				</li>
				<li>
						<p>Most important, JavaServer Faces technology provides a rich architecture for managing component state, processing component data, validating user input,
							and handling events.
						</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Comparision Of Spring MVC, Struts, JSF</h3>

			<h3 dir="ltr">Spring MVC</h3>

			<p dir="ltr">Unlike the convention-over-configuration frameworks like Grails and Play, Spring MVC is heavy and dense despite taking advantage of the Model-View-Controller
				paradigm (Spring -&gt; MVC &lt;-). Updating and code maintenance is manageable if you&rsquo;re already familiar with the intricacies of the framework and the project
				itself, but if you&rsquo;re just diving in it can be a little overwhelming and slow going. But still, annotations enable to access all kinds of data in a declarative 
				manner and this way, not much hacking is needed
			</p>

			<h3 dir="ltr">Struts</h3>

			<p dir="ltr">Similarly to Spring MVC, maintenance should not be a big problem if you are familiar with Struts, but if you are new to the project, the learning curve can
			be steep. Even if you have experience with Struts, your new project may have a bit different structure and different configuration.
			</p>

			<h3 dir="ltr">JSF</h3>

			<p dir="ltr">JSF projects leverage existing design paradigms such as Model-View-Controller to help enforce maintainability and readability. The framework itself does not
				have any features that particularly impact readability or maintainability. One of the stated goals of JSF is to help developers produce better code, but we do not see
				how they facilitate that.
